When you need to render user provided HTML content but don't want to trust the user content with Ember's ` Ember.String.htmlSafe` or `{{{  }}}`.
Uses [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/) to sanitize HTML & SVG. I strongly recommend you watch the video linked under the [inspiration](#inspiration) section. See XSS in action in Ember in [this twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/e41681e00585f3c94b461e349fee9ca1?fileTreeShown=false&numColumns=2&openFiles=templates.application.hbs%2Ccontrollers.application.js).

You can also run `ember serve` to see the above mentioned approaches along with the `purify-dom` helper. Inspect the DOM on all three broken images to see the difference.

## Installation
```shell
ember install ember-purify
```

## Usage 
```handlebars
{{purify-dom '<img src="missing-image.png" onerror=alert(1)//>'}}
```
will render
```html
<img src="missing-image.png">
```
Details on DOMPurify, the underlying library can be found in its [README](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/master/README.md)

## Configuration
To configure the purify helper globally in your app's `config/environment.js`,
```js
ENV.APP.purify = {
  // Refer to various config options in DOMPurify's README
};
```
